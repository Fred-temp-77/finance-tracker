This application is a Personal Finance Tracker that:
-
  -Displays the monthly income.  
  -Shows expenses across 4 categories- Rent, Personal Growth, Food, and Recreation.  
  -Allows users to add new transactions and displays each transaction, their amount, category, and description.  
  -Includes a basic budget feature where users can set budget limits and can tell how much of their limit has been reached.  
  -Uses localStorage  

What I would improve with more time:
-
  -Centralise the application state to make the components cleaner and have fewer bugs.  
  -Responsive Design  
  -Budget feedback as a part of the user experience.  
  -Animations that give the UI a more fun feel  
  -Better forms  
  -Time-based budgeting, like monthly budgets that automatically reset. Users can also look back on previous months.  
  -Cleaner folder structure  
  -Comments  

Challenges faced:
-
  -Translating ideas into code logic. I eventually got used to it, but the charts proved to be a great deal of trouble.  
  -Started late, unfortunately, and was crunched for time.  

Approximately two days were spent on this project.
